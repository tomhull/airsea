\title{Net community production (NCP) from O2}
\usage{
O2NCP.mean(dat, kw_method = "WA13", bubbleoff = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{data frame matching the format outlined in \link[airsea]{O2NCP.transform}}

\item{kw_method}{character string passed to kw, default is 'WA13'}

\item{bubbleoff}{}
}
\value{
a vector of NCP in mmol per m-3 per supplied time interval
}
\description{
calculate net community production based on mean O2 observations.
}
\details{
Full explanation of the method and methods are found in Hull et al,
  2015 Entrainment will only be calculated where an
  \code{entrainment} variable is found in the input data and it's value is
  \code{TRUE}. When being using within a monte-carlo analysis you can include
  bias estimates in the following variables \code{kw_error, B_error,
  Csat_error}. Where these variables are found these parameters will be
  scaled accordingly.
